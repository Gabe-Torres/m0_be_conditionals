# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
Coditionals are useful for booleans or true and false codes. 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would do my git commands git add, git commit, and git push after each of the activities to make sure the repo gets pushed to github correctly.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I started the assignment last night but it seemed much more overwhemlng. After calling it and getting some rest the assignmnet flowed much faster. So its satisfying seeing the code work and I learned that rest and a clear mind is very important.
